    <p>Hello, and welcome to my online web development portfolio.  My name is Tony Stemen and I am a successful business owner who has workied in the field of talent acquisiton for nearly 20 years.</p> 
    <p>I have always had an interest in technology and conding.  For many years I bought the lie that it is "too late" to begin a career in software development.  I decided to put those voices behind me, and dive in to begin learning this skillset in my 40's.</p>
